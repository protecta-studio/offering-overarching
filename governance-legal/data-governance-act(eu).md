Introduction to the Data Governance Act ("DGA"):

The Data Governance Act "DGA" is the latest EU regulation on data governance which came into force as of 23 June 2022, follwing a 15-month grace period will be applicable across the EU from September 2023. The EU envisions that the DGA will continue the work established by the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) ("GDPR) where the GDPR regulates the categorization of data and in turn data sharing of data within the EU and internationally. On the inverse,  the Open Data and the Re-use of Public Sector Information Directure (2019/1024) ("Open Data Directive" or "ODD") which broadents the datatsets for open data. However, this has not been without scrutiny with the EC  already refering 4 member states (Belgium Bulgaria, Latvia and the Netherlands) to the ECJ for failing to enact EU rules on open data and public sector data re-use as of January 2023. The DGA throws a new consideration by introducing a new category of "data altruism" and envisions a structural system of data sharing to achieve this goal by creating an European alternative to existing major tech  platforms.

The balancing act between the ODD and DGA will be how ODD regulates the re-use of publicly/available information held by the public sector, which currently would be protected data e.g. personal data or commercially confidential data as per the GDPR and the DGA providing the rules and safeguard for this purpose.  DGA centers on  data altruism, whereby the balancing act of voluntary sharing data  and without reward serves the public interest (see point 16 of Article 2). The EU believes there is a williningess to do so but hampered by a lack of data sharing tools and has incoporated in Article 25 a European data altruism consent form to allow collection of permission across the EU in a uniform form and using a modular approach (came to this later, but wanted to add). EU proposes that the DGA addresses the below concerns:

1. Technical capacity for the the public sector: Member States will need create the appropriate infrastructure toensure that the privacy and confidentiality of data under both national, EU (GDPR) and international laws is fully respected in re-use situations. This can include a range of tools, from technical solutions, such as anonymisation, pseudonymisation or accessing data in secure processing environments (e.g. data rooms) supervised by the public sector, to contractual means such as confidentiality agreements concluded between the public sector body and the re-user. Member States can choose which competent bodies will support the public sector bodies granting access to the re-use for example by providing the latter with a secure processing environment and by advising them on how to best structure and store data to make it easily accessible.The issue of enforcement and extra territorial will come into play;

2. Limit the use of exclusive data re-use agreements whereby a public sector body grants such an exclusive right to one company to specific cases of public interest thereby pivoting from a transactional perspective to a singel information point;

3. Creation of single information point: The EC will create a European single access point with a register of national single information point. Data is becoming a commodity covered the freedom movement principle (see reference, i saw it somehwere) so this would be in line with those principles);

4. Assistance from the public sector body: If a public sector body cannot grant access to certain data for re-use, it should assist the potential re-user in seeking the individual’s consent to re-use their personal data) or the data holder’s permission whose rights or interests may be affected by the re-use. On the other hand,  confidential information (e.g. trade secrets) can be disclosed for re-use only with such consent or permission. The DGA creates an appeal structyre where A public sector body will have up to 2 months to take a decision on a re-use request subject to reasonable fees to counter the commercialization of data and promote the re-use for scientific research and other non-commercial purposes as well as by SMEs and start-ups, by reducing or even excluding charging.

Key to the proposal set forward for the DGA is the role of Data intermediation services (reference point 11 Article 11). DGA defines it as a service which aims to establish commercial relationship (contradiction between data altruism and an in essence a business model(, for purposes of data sharing between an undetermined data subjects and holders and data use through thechical, legal and other means:
a. sservices that obtain data from data holders and aggregate, enrich or transform the data for the purpose of adding substantial value to it and license the use of the resulting data to data users, without establishing a commercial relationship (So the serivice is commercial but the goal is...yucky) between data holders and data users;
b. services that focus on the intermediation of copyright-protected content; (this will also throw the wrench of national, EU and international copyright as to what is a protected right in China is different from EU);
c. services that are exclusively used by one data holder in order to enable the use of the data held by that data holder, or that are used by multiple legal persons in a closed group, including supplier or customer relationships or collaborations established by contract, in particular those that have as a main objective to ensure the functionalities of objects and devices connected to the Internet of Things;
d. data sharing services offered by public sector bodies that do not aim to establish commercial relationships.(I need to dig deeper here cuz they menetion a multiude of sectors in the definition of data altruism but all things are somewhat commercial in nature so I am thrown by where that is established) (sidebar...the governance tools for the private sector to share data will be tricky...what is non commcerial, not protected data, that slots in here is problematic);

The framework offers an alternative model to the data-handling practices of the Big Tech platforms, which have a high degree of market power because they control large amounts of data. To this end, Article 13 of the DGA requires each member state to monitor data imtermediaries or data intermdiation service providers tasks in accordance with the scope of  Article 12 of the DGA. The aforementioned Article imposes several requirements on data intermediation primarily: 
- data intermediaries will need to neutral third partiy thet connect data holders and data user solely and cannot monetise the data (e.g. by selling it to another company or using it to develop their own product based on this data);
- restriction on the collection of data on the data users i.e. shall only be collected for provision of the service e.g. fraud prevention, cybersecurity, etc but not building of a data profile;
- additional serivces can provided related to data exchange such as conversion, storage etc. while the commercial terms, includingh pricing for data intermediation shall not dependent on the provision of other services;
-  data intermediation services provider provides tools for obtaining consent from data subjects or permissions to process data made available by data holders, it shall, where relevant, specify the third-country jurisdiction in which the data use is intended to take plac.

Both stand-alone organisations providing data intermediation services only and companies that offer data intermediation services in addition to other services could function as trusted intermediaries. In the latter case, the data intermediation activity must be strictly separated, both legally and economically, from other data services. Under the DGA, data intermediaries will be required to notify the competent authority of their intention to provide such services. The competent authority will ensure that the notification procedure is non-discriminatory and does not distort competition and will confirm that the data intermediation services provider has submitted the notification containing all required information. Upon receipt of such a confirmation, the data intermediary can legally start to operate and use the label ‘data intermediation services provider recognised in the Union’ in its written and spoken communication, as well as the common logo. Those authorities will also monitor compliance with the data intermediation requirements and the Commission will keep a central register of data intermediaries.

The EC also called for the free and safe flow of data with third countries, subject to exceptions and restrictions for public security, public order and other legitimate public policy objectives of the Union, in line with international obligations, including on fundamental rights that the GDPR has put in place all the necessary safeguards in the context of personal data. DGA tries to tackle this in various ways but primiarily Article 31. Data intermediation services provider or the recognised data altruism organisation shall take all reasonable technical, legal and organisational measures, including contractual arrangements, in order to prevent international transfer or governmental access to non-personal data held in the Union where such transfer or access would create a conflict with Union law or the national law of the relevant Member State unless permitted by virtue of international agreement e.g. mutual legal assistance treaty or order e.g. administrative or judgment. 

Pursuant to ODD, the EC published a high-value datasets that public sector bodies will have to make available for re-use, free of charge, within 16 month (from 21 december 2022). Datasets are Discussion on high-value datasets to be made available for re-use geospatial, earth observation and environment, meteorological, statistics, companies and mobility. This thematic range can be extended at a later stage to reflect technological and market developments. The datasets will be available in machine-readable format, via an Application Programming Interface and, where relevant, as bulk download.

The re-use of datasets such as mobility or geolocalisation of buildings can open business opportunities for the logistics or transport sectors, as well as improve the efficiency of public service delivery, for example by understanding traffic flows to make transport more efficient. Meteorological observation data, radar data, air quality and soil contamination data can also support research and digital innovation as well as better-informed policymaking, especially in the fight against climate change.

The registration of recognised data altruism organisations and use of the label ‘data altruism organisation recognised in the Union’ is expected to lead to the establishment of data repositories. Registration in a Member State would be valid across the Union and is expected to facilitate cross-border data use within the Union and the emergence of data pools covering several Member States. Data holders could give permission to the processing of their non-personal data for a range of purposes not established at the moment of giving the permission. 

Further safeguards should include making it possible to process relevant data within a secure processing environment operated by the recognised data altruism organisations, oversight mechanisms such as ethics councils or boards, including representatives from civil society to ensure that the data controller maintains high standards of scientific ethics and protection of fundamental rights, effective and clearly communicated technical means to withdraw or modify consent at any moment, on the basis of the information obligations of data processors under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), as well as means for data subjects to stay informed about the use of data they made available. Registration as a recognised data altruism organisation should not be a precondition for exercising data altruism activities. The Commission should, by means of delegated acts, prepare a rulebook in close cooperation with data altruism organisations and relevant stakeholders. Compliance with that rulebook should be a requirement for registration as a recognised data altruism organisation. The development of the rulebook is pivotal. European Data Innovation Board (EDIB) to facilitate the sharing of best practices (reference is in later part of the DGA - Article 29 and 30) , in particular on data intermediation, data altruism and the use of public data that cannot be made available as open data, as well as on the prioritisation of cross-sectoral interoperability standards. The EDIB will consist of representatives from the following entities:

Member State competent authorities for data intermediation
Member State competent authorities for data altruism
the European Data Protection Board
the European Data Protection Supervisor
the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)
the European Commission
the EU SME Envoy/representative appointed by the network of SME envoys
other representatives of relevant bodies (The Commission will launch a call for experts to this end)
It will operate through at least three sub-groups:

a sub-group consisting of representatives of Member State competent authorities,
a sub-group for technical discussions on standardisation, portability and interoperability, and
a sub-group for stakeholder involvement.
