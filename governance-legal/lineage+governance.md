# Data lineage & governance


## Data lineage

Enables you to track how data flows and changes across different systems, platforms and applications. It helps you to understand where your data comes from, how it is transformed, enriched, aggregated and consumed, and what are the dependencies, relationships and impacts among different data elements.

Data lineage can be classified into three types: technical, business and operational. Technical lineage shows how data moves from source to target through various ETL processes, transformations, joins and filters. Business lineage shows how data supports business objectives, decisions and outcomes. Operational lineage shows how data is monitored, secured and governed throughout its lifecycle.

Purposes of data lineage

- Data quality assessment: Data lineage helps you to identify data quality issues such as errors, inconsistencies or anomalies in your data sources or processes. It also helps you to trace back the root causes of these issues and fix them accordingly.
- Data governance: Data lineage helps you to establish policies, standards and rules for managing your data assets. It also helps you to enforce compliance with regulations such as GDPR or CCPA by documenting how personal or sensitive data is collected, processed and stored.
- Data discovery: Data lineage helps you to discover new or relevant data sources that can enhance your analysis or insights. It also helps you to understand the context and meaning of your data by providing metadata such as definitions, descriptions or tags.
- Data security: Data lineage helps you to protect your data from unauthorized access or misuse by providing visibility into who accesses your data, when they access it and what they do with it. It also helps you to detect any breaches or anomalies in your data access patterns.

Best practices¹²:

- Automate data lineage extraction
	- Manual documentation of data lineage is time-consuming, error-prone and outdated. You should use automated tools that can scan your data sources and processes and generate visual maps of your data flows.
- Trace multiple types of lineage
	- You should capture both technical and business aspects of your data flows to get a holistic view of your data landscape. You should also include operational aspects such as performance metrics or alerts in your lineage maps.
- Put data lineage to work
	- You should not treat data lineage as a one-time exercise but rather as an ongoing process that supports your business needs. You should integrate your lineage maps with other tools such as dashboards, reports or catalogs that can help you leverage your data effectively.
- Trace data lineage comprehensively
	- You should cover all stages of your data lifecycle from ingestion to consumption in your lineage maps. You should also include external sources or targets that interact with your internal systems.
